##  ðŸ’» About the project</br> </br>
The project was proposed at IronHack's Data Analytics BootCamp..

In order to train the first lessons learned with Python, we developed a game in juppyter notebook.
The game chosen by me was the number memorization game, where the player reads a randomly generated number, memorizes and types it. The number of digits increases as the player progresses within the game.

## ðŸ›  Technologies


The analyzes were developed in the Python language, using the Jupyter Notebook and its libraries.
